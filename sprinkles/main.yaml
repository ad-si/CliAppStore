  Sprinkles is a tool that provides HTML front-ends to diverse data backends,
  based on a YAML configuration file,
  and a collection of templates and static files.

  With sprinkles, you can turn a basic JSON API, or a collection of Markdown,
  YAML and JSON files, into a full-blown content-driven website.
  Sprinkles can act as a UI layer for a complex web service,
  or as a front-end for a poor man's CMS,
  or as a drop-in replacement for a static site generator.

changelog:
  - version: 0.5.0.0
    utc: 2018-02-06
    url: https://github.com/tdammers/sprinkles/releases/tag/0.5.0.0
    changes:
      - Serve multiple sites at once on separate ports
      - Make all paths absolute (based on project-relative paths)

  - version: 0.4.3.0
    utc: 2017-06-26
    url: https://github.com/tdammers/sprinkles/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0430
    changes:
      - Nicer YAML syntax for SQL backend.

  - version: 0.4.2.0
    utc: 2017-06-26
    url: https://github.com/tdammers/sprinkles/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0420
    changes:
      - Handle SQL NULL more leniently in the SQL backend;
        NULL values in the result
        set are now passed to Ginger as null, rather than failing.
      - "Multi-query SQL backend: the SQL backend now accepts an alternative
        spec syntax. Instead of `query` and `params`,
        it can now also take just one `queries` key,
        containing a list of query string + params array pairs.
        Queries are executed against the params they come with, in order,
        and all the queries in the backend are run within the same transaction."
      - Turned on partial pattern match warnings, and fixed them all.
      - Added a missing template in an example project
      - Expose backend data in templated rule specs.
        This means that it is now
        possible to change, for example, the selected template, or the redirect
        target, based on backend data.
