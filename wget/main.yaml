description: Tool for retrieving files using HTTP(S) and FTP(S)
description_long: |
  GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using
  HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS the most widely-used Internet protocols.
  It is a non-interactive commandline tool,
  so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs,
  terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

  GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files
  or mirroring entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

  - Can resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE
  - Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
  - NLS-based message files for many different languages
  - Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative,
    so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
  - Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
  - Supports HTTP proxies
  - Supports HTTP cookies
  - Supports persistent HTTP connections
  - Unattended / background operation
  - Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be
    re-downloaded when mirroring
  - GNU Wget is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
