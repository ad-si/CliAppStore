changelog:
  - version: "1.10"
    utc: 2018-06-30
    url: http://hledger.org/release-notes.html#hledger-1.10
    changes:
      - "journal: many parse error messages have become more informative, and
        some now show the source line and error location."
      - "journal: ;tag: is no longer parsed as a tag named “;tag” (#655)"
      - "journal: transaction price amounts having their own price amounts is
        now a parse error"
      - "journal: amounts with space as digit group separator and trailing
        whitespace now parse correctly (#780)"
      - "journal: in amounts containing digits and a single space, the space is
        now interpreted as a digit group separator,
        not a decimal separator (#749)"
      - "journal: in commodity/format/D directives, the amount must now include
        a decimal separator.
        When more precise control is needed over number parsing, our
        recommended solution is commodity directives.
        Commodity directives that don’t
        specify the decimal separator leave things ambiguous,
        increasing the chance of misparsing numbers.
        In some cases it could cause amounts with a decimal point
        to be parsed as if with a digit group separator, so 1.234 became 1234.
        It seems the simple and really only way to do this reliably is to
        require an explicit decimal point character.
        Most folks probably do this already.
        Unfortunately, it makes another potential incompatiblity with ledger
        and beancount journals.
        But the error message will be clear and easy to work around."
      - "journal: directives currently have diverse and somewhat tricky
        semantics, especially with multiple files.
        The manual now describes their behaviour precisely."
      - "journal: alias and apply account directives now affect account
        directives (#825)"
      - "journal: periodic transactions can now have all the usual transaction
        fields (status mark, code, description, comment), for generating more
        expressive forecast transactions."
      - "journal: forecast transactions now have the generating period
        expression attached as a tag named “recur”."
      - "journal: periodic transactions now start on the first instance of the
        recurring date,
        rather than the day after the last regular transaction (#750)"
      - "journal: periodic transaction rules now allow period expressions
        relative to today’s date"
      - "csv: amount-in/amount-out errors are more detailed"
      - "balance: –drop is now ignored when not in flat mode, rather than
        producing a corrupted report (#754)"
      - "budget: –drop now preserves the top-level account in –budget reports"
      - "register: in CSV output, the code field is now included (#746)"
      - "smart dates now allow the YYYYMM format, and are better documented"
      - "uses hledger-lib 1.10"
