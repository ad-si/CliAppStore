changelog:
  - version: '2.24'
    utc: '2018-06-21'
    changes:
      - No changes since 2.23_03.

  - version: '2.23_03'
    utc: '2018-06-15'
    changes:
      - Added --ts for Typescript
      - ack would stop searching if there was a file called "0" in the current
        directory where ack was invoked

  - version: '2.23_02'
    utc: '2018-01-06'
    changes:
      - t/ack-n.t was not calling lists_match() correctly
      - Added an optimization to make ack only do a line-by-line search of a
        file if there's a match somewhere in the file. This gives ack a 20-30%
        in timings of common cases.

  - version: '2.22'
    utc: '2017-12-22'
    changes:
      - No changes since 2.21_01

  - version: '2.00'
    utc: '2013-04-17'
    changes:
      - By default searches all text files,
        as identified by Perl's `-T` operator
      - We will no longer have a `-a` switch.
      - Improved flexibility in defining filetype selectors
      - name equality ($filename eq 'Makefile')
      - glob-style matching (`*.pl` identifies a Perl file)
      - regex-style matching (`/\.pl$/i` identifies a Perl file)
      - shebang-line matching (shebang line matching `/usr/bin/perl/`
        identifies a Perl file)
      - support for multiple ackrc files
      - global ackrc (/etc/ackrc)
      - https://github.com/petdance/ack/issues/#issue/79
      - user-specific ackrc (~/.ackrc)
      - per-project ackrc files (~/myproject/.ackrc)
      - you can use --dump to figure which options are set where
      - all inclusion/exclusion rules will be in the ackrc files
      - ack 2.0 has a set of definitions for filetypes, directories to
        include or exclude, etc, *but* these are only included so you don't
        need to ship an ackrc file to a new machine.  You may tell ack to
        disregard these defaults if you like.
      - In addition to the classic `--thpppt` option to draw Bill the
        Cat, `ack --bar` will draw (of course) Admiral Ackbar.
