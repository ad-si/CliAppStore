description: The automatic rule based time tracker
description_long: |
  The Automatic Rule-Based Time Tracker is a desktop daemon
  that runs in the background and, every minute,
  records what windows are open on your desktop,
  what their titles are, which one is active.
  The accompanied statistics program lets you derive information
  from this log file,
  i.e. how much of your time have you been spending with e-mail,
  or what projects are your largest time wasters.
  The mapping from the raw window titles to sensible "tags"
  is done by a configuration file with an powerful syntax.
