description_long: |
  GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
  other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

  Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
  called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how
  to compute it from other files.
  When you write a program, you should
  write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build
  and install the program.

  Capabilities of Make

  - Make enables the end user to build and install your package
    without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these
    details are recorded in the makefile that you supply.

  - Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update,
    based on which source files have changed.
    It also automatically
    determines the proper order for updating files, in case one
    non-source file depends on another non-source file.

    As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make,
    it does not need to recompile all of your program.
    It updates only
    those non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the
    source files that you changed.

  - Make is not limited to any particular language. For each
    non-source file in the program, the makefile specifies the shell
    commands to compute it.
    These shell commands can run a compiler to
    produce an object file, the linker to produce an executable, ar to
    update a library, or TeX or Makeinfo to format documentation.

  - Make is not limited to building a package.
    You can also use Make
    to control installing or deinstalling a package, generate tags tables
    for it, or anything else you want to do often enough to make it worth
    while writing down how to do it.
