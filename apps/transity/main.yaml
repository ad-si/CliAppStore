description: Intuitive plain text accounting tool
description_long: |
  We found existing plain text accounting tools unsatisfactory,
  so we developed Transity.
  It models financial flows in terms of transactions
  and not debited / credited accounts.
  Furthermore, its journal format is based on YAML
  and can therefore easily be processed by 3rd party tools.
  Also, it's written in PureScript.
