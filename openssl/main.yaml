description: TLS/SSL and crypto library
description_long: |
  The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
  commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols (including SSLv3) as well as a
  full-strength general purpose cryptographic library.

  OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
  and Tim J. Hudson.  The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under a dual-license (the
  OpenSSL license plus the SSLeay license), which means that you are free to
  get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes as long as you
  fulfill the conditions of both licenses.
